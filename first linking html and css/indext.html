		<h3>
			James Gunn apologized for his old jokes
		</h3>
		<img src="images/pic.png">
		<p>The now-deleted tweets, sent by Gunn between 2008 and 2011, first began trending after Pizzagate conspiracy theorists Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec drew attention to them, likely in retribution for Gunn’s outspoken criticism of President Donald Trump.

		The tweets made frequent mention of topics like pedophilia and rape. Numerous other highly sensitive subjects, including the Sept. 11 terror attacks, AIDS and the holocaust were also mentioned.

		<h3>
			Gunn apologized for what he described
		</h3>
		<p>“I remember my first NAMBLA meeting,” reads one tweet, referring to the “North American Man/Boy Love Association,” a pedophile advocacy group. “It was the first time I felt ok being who I am.”

		Another, sent in February 2009, reads, “The best thing about being raped is when you’re done being raped and it’s like ‘whew this feels great, not being raped!’”
